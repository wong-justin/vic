# summary of potential livereload tools:
# - entr leaves tty available for my tui, but it fails to restart/send SIGTERM
# - watchexec hogs tty so i cannot run a tui, although it restarts and exits well
# - gaze leaves tty available for my tui, and restarts my tui/sends SIGTERM, but error messages are borked (see https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/issues/194), and i cannot kill the gaze process gracefully
#
# also useful to run in other windows during development:
# - tail -f /tmp/vic_log
# - bacon, for better error/warning messages
#

	# git ls-files | entr -cs 'cargo run ~/test/test.mp4'
	
# something like:
# ffmpeg create frames containing text label for each frame (1,2,etc)
# ffmpeg create long, colorful .mp4
# ffmpeg create short .mp4 with audio
# ffmpeg create equivalent .opus
#
# not quite as good as testing videos from the wild,
# but that's what gh issues are for i guess
