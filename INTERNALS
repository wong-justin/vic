vic depends on ffmpeg and chafa

vic makes ffmpeg calls, assuming ffmpeg is on $PATH:
- main::get_ffprobe_video_metadata() calls ffprobe (a sibling of ffmpeg) to get video dimensions and framerate
- main::FrameIterator calls ffmpeg to decode a video file into rgb bytes
- main::main() calls ffmpeg to cut the video into segments (if any segments were made)

calling ffmpeg process on $PATH seemed easier than trying to link ffmpeg libraries
one less build step
ffmpeg performance still seems fine
hopefully there's no downsides

chafa is a dynamically linked C library, meaning it already needs to be installed on the user's system. the chafa binary is not needed here, but rather the development libraries and header files.
nothing in place to guarantee/check specific chafa versions; i just went with the latest chafa version at the time, and hopefully it will work for everyone

chafa-sys/ is a sub-crate (?) for creating rust bindings to chafa's C code.
chafa-sys/build.rs has a lot of comments from me figuring out the expected setup
chafa-sys/build.rs::build_dynamic() is the least-boilerplate part of the bindings build; just calling `clang -I chafastuff`, really
everything else in chafa-sys is just boilerplate; lib.rs for a couple tests, wrapper.h just needs to exist for clang i think, and bindgen crate included in Cargo.toml
bindgen creates bindings file at target/debug/build/chafa-sys-abc123something/out/bindings.rs
there's a lot of unused code there, like functions i will never need like `g_get_user_state_dir`, but oh well
i think i can trim the bindings by whitelisting only necessary functions

no static builds yet
static builds involve several new challenges, including glib
glib like a third-party stdlib for C, including threading implementations, string handling, etc
glib is chafa's only dependency
building / statically linking glib is nontrivial

src/chafa.rs wraps the lowish-level chafa bindings (eg. unsafe chafa_canvas_new() and unsafe chafa_canvas_unref()) into high-level rust structs (eg. Canvas impl new() and drop())
mainly just hiding C pointers and exposing

src/tui.rs is a generic MVU TUI setup
(model, view, update for a text-based UI)
(essentially the elm architecture)

requires functions of type:
init -> result<model, error>
view (model, stderr) -> (draws on stderr, returns nothing)
update (model, event) -> continue/finish/failed

uses crossterm crate for a standardized API for terminal emulator communication

current, naive event loop:
frequently polling the terminal for events like keypresses or resizes
responding to any events received
drawing new frames when appropriate (like ~33ms for 30fps videos) (or after a keypress)
no multithreaded/async event loop yet

all TUI output is written to stderr on the alternate tty buffer
(stdout is reserved for potential messages after app shutdown, e.g. `vic video.mp4 --print-timestamps`)

___
src/main.rs::FrameIterator is where ffmpeg and chafa meet
chafa is initialized with config like input and output size
each frame, ffmpeg decodes video into rgb bytes
chafa takes rgb bytes and returns a string of ansi colors and unicode blocks, like  "[0m[38;2;254;0;0m█[0m", that will be sent to the terminal

src/main.rs::Model contains app state
including config like video dimensions
and also state like current frame number and the list of timestamps (called markers)

src/main.rs::update() is a big match statement handling events and keypresses

keypresses so far are just for moving to different parts of the video and making/deleting markers

some demo capture ideas:
inside a neovim :terminal session,
use the :ShowKeys toggle plugin
then screencap with obs

or for static images, consider
```
vic ~/test/test.mp4 2>&1 | tee ~/test/vicscreenoutput
# print 2500 or however many lines of screen output it took to create the desired screen
cat ~/test/vicscreenoutput | head -2500 ; printf '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
```

taken from:
https://pgadey.ca/notes/writing-ritual/

- am i cozy?
- do i have water?
- is the source code open?
- do i have a notebook nearby?
- is my phone muted / far away?
- do i have an entry point / is the work log updated?
- did i listen to one of the songs?

- did i freewrite/warmup for a couple minutes?
