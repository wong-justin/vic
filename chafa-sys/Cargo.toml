# even tho this upgraded bindgen requires rustc 1.70.1+
# im using rustc >= 1.80.1 now, so it's ok

# "For linking I went with simply outputting cargo:rustc-link-lib= from build.rs,
# with ability to set the library path with an environment variable (no pkg-config)
# and with default path on Windows set to where the library installer
